# Engineered-a-Remote-Controlled-Fire-Fighting-Robot-
A Bluetooth-controlled fire-fighting robot equipped with flame sensors and a water-spraying mechanism. Detects and extinguishes fires remotely, reducing human risk. Enables real-time navigation and is ideal for industrial and residential safety applications.
A remote-controlled robotic system designed to detect and extinguish fires using Bluetooth communication.
Equipped with flame sensors for fire detection and a water-spraying mechanism for suppression, the robot can
be operated from a safe distance, reducing human risk in hazardous environments. The project demonstrates
efficient fire-fighting capabilities with real-time remote navigation, making it suitable for industrial and
residential safety applications.
